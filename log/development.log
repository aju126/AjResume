Below I've listed some tips for newcomers to the Ruby system.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: 'Gotham SSm A', 'Gotham SSm B', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; letter-spacing: -0.21px;\" data-id=\"26cc703a934ff13aa5689613d4fa794c1\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">Callbacks</span>&nbsp;- Use them wisely!</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: 'Gotham SSm A', 'Gotham SSm B', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; letter-spacing: -0.21px;\" data-id=\"5567553828a19c918005d4f181b115b11\">What are callbacks? Callbacks are methods that play a&nbsp;<a style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; text-decoration-line: none; color: #003399 !important;\" href=\"http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_callbacks.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">specific role&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;in an object's life cycle. They can be really useful. For instance, using callbacks could help satisfy initial conditions placed on a certain object class, as seen in&nbsp;<a style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; text-decoration-line: none; color: #003399 !important;\" href=\"https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/the-only-acceptable-use-for-callbacks-in-rails-ever/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this example.&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: 'Gotham SSm A', 'Gotham SSm B', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; letter-spacing: -0.21px;\" data-id=\"51ce62e7dea2ddc8ef783caa5e18a1251\">However, using a lot of callbacks, or especially chained callbacks can be problematic. A failed callback can leave your model in an invalid state, which could compound with other callbacks failing and lead to pesky app malfunctions.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: 'Gotham SSm A', 'Gotham SSm B', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; letter-spacing: -0.21px;\" data-id=\"0866230aef0635d5b773033474c409241\">To sum, using callbacks wisely can lend to cleaner, less buggy, and more readable code.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: 'Gotham SSm A', 'Gotham SSm B', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; letter-spacing: -0.21px;\" data-id=\"40df31305036568862241049a7c273691\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">Scopes</span>&nbsp;- Use more scopes!</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: 'Gotham SSm A', 'Gotham SSm B', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; letter-spacing: -0.21px;\" data-id=\"498407fa10105752d5fc77d8b0d802f51\"><a style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; text-decoration-line: none; color: #003399 !important;\" href=\"http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Scoping/Named/ClassMethods.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Scopes&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;are excellent in Rails.
